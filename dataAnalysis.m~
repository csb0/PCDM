%     Purpose: Pre-processes eye data and estimates inputs to model.
%
%              Specifically does the following: blink interpolation
%              (optional), bandpass filtering of pupil data, saccade
%              detection, deconvolution of saccade-locked pupil response,
%              estimation of task-evoked pupil response (can format data
%              to lock pupil response to various events, e.g., task onset,
%              cues, or button press), estimation of saccade rate
%              function(s) (one per trial type, e.g., correct vs. error
%              trials).
%
%     Inputs:
%
%              input struct "in" with fields containing cell array with one
%              cell per run of data. Field names:
%
%              - yPos: horizontal gaze position in dva (column vector)
%              - yPos: vertical gaze position in dva (column vector)
%                      (the coodinates (0,0) should be at fixation)
%              - pupilArea: pupil area (column vector)
%              - startInds: trial start indexes in samples (n x 2 matrix
%                with trial start and end times, n is number of trials)
%              - sampleRate: sampling rate of eye tracker (Hz)
%              - trialTypes: trial types (e.g., easy / hard, or corr\error)
%                integers for each trial, e.g. 1,2,3,4,5 (1 x n vector)
%              - predictionWindow: time window beyond trial onset to make a
%                prediction within (e.g. 4 sec in a jittered ISI expt)
%
%              options struct "op" with field names:
%
%              - interpolateBlinks (0 or 1) to interpolate blinks from pupil
%                time series (only use if you are inputting eyeLink data,
%                otherwise, do this step yourself)
%              - downsampleRate for deconvolution of saccade-locked pupil
%                response (default 5)
%              - fittimeSeries (0 or 1) to base the gain estimates on the
%                entire time series (like an fMRI linear systems analysis).
%                This is useful if you have overlapping trial types or if
%                you want to account for shared variance between trial
%                types. If set to 0, it will fit each trial type separately
%                based on the trial-average.
%

%% Set options
op.interpolateBlinks = 1; % 1, blink interpolation on; 0, interpolation off (use this if your input data is already blink interpolated)
op.downsampleRate = 5; % downsample rate for the deconvolution design matrix. Higher numbers makes code run faster, but shouldn't be set higher than Nyquist frequency.
op.fitTimeseries = 0; % if you want to estimate gain based on the whole pupil time series, set to 1. To just estimate gain based just on the trial-average (per trial type), set to 0. If you're just fitting more than one overlapping trial type and you want to take into account variance shared between them, set this to 1

in.putativeIRFdur = 4; % how long you think the saccade-locked pupil response is in seconds. User-defined, but 4 s is a good estimate according to our results and the literature
in.predictionWindow = 4; % The time window you want to make the prediction for the TEPR, beyond the trial onset time (in seconds). Usually the max trial length (if you're using jittered trial durations) or the experimenter-set trial duration (if you're using fixed trial durations), but can be shorter if you want.
