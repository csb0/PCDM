## Usage ##########################################################
To use the toolbox, navigate to PCDM directory in MATLAB, run the command addpath(genpath(pwd)). Then, create an input data struct “in” containing your eye data, task event timing, and trial types (see DataAnalysis.m for details on formatting) and run fitModel. The toolbox takes in the raw gaze position and pupil area time series. The code was tested on data collected with an EyeLink eye tracker, but should work with data from other systems. The function fitModel.m returns a struct “f” containing the model’s parameter estimates, prediction of the task-evoked pupil response, and goodness of fit (R^2), as well as plots of the model fits and parameter estimates for each run/block of data.

If you are using pupil data that already has blinks removed, set “op.blinkInterpolation” to 0 in the preamble of the function dataAnalysis.m. Otherwise, set “op.blinkInterpolation” to 1 (it is already by default), and the code will perform blink interpolation.

For estimating gain correctly, 5 minutes of eye data suffices. If you’d like to make a relatively noiseless estimate of the generator function at a very high sampling rate (e.g., 500 or 1000 Hz), it is important to use a large amount of data (around 200 minutes of eye data). If you want to estimate the generator function at a lower sampling rate, simply downsample your input data (e.g. to 200 Hz), and you will require much less data for good estimation of the generator function. This is common practice in analyzing saccade rates and will often be desirable because the underlying neural process is unlikely to occur at more than 200 Hz. So don’t downsample your input data below 200 Hz, to be conservative. Important note: if you do downsample your input data, change the parameter op.downsampleRate to 1, so you don’t further unnecessarily downsample your data again when doing deconvolutions (which is only for speeding up the code). 

## Example Data ###################################################
We include two runs of real data from our 4 s experiment, so you can see how the input data is structured and reproduce the model fits from our paper. The trial types included in in.trialTypes simply encode correct (“2”) and error (“1”) trials. This is just an example. As a general rule, it’s important to roughly equalize the amount of data (really, the number of saccades) in each trial type. So you may want to analyze unequal numbers of trials per condition, in order to roughly equalize the number of saccades within each condition (found in the variable d.nSaccsPerTrialType).

## Variants/Extensions ############################################

### Locking the pupil response to task events other than trial onset
If you’d like to examine the pupil response to other task events (e.g., button press, cues), simply create a column vector with the start times of these events (in units of samples) called “eventTimes” and replace each instance of “in.startInds{kk}(:,1)” on lines 100 and 123 of dataAnalysis.m with it. If you are analyzing multiple trial types, make the variable a cell array with one cell per trial type containing the vector of event times. This will estimate an event-locked pupil response and saccade rate function.

If you’d like to do this with multiple events simultaneously and take into account their shared variance, you must create a block design matrix with a block for each event separately for deconvolving the saccade rate function and pupil response (see Knapen et al 2016, *PLOS One* for example).

### Estimating multiple gains per trial
If you have some reason to think the gain changes within a trial, you can estimate multiple gains per trial by modifying gainFinder so that the gain is a vector instead of a scalar, where it’s length is the trial length. Usually you will make this gain vector a piece-wise constant function, so that there, say, one gain before the button press or other cue, and another gain after. If you are going to run an experiment with longer trials, for example a jittered ISI experiment with ISIs up to 6-8 seconds, you probably want to fit at least two gains per trial, because arousal should be expected to get lower at the end of the long trial due to disengagement. You can do parameter recovery simulations to see how much data you will need to constrain estimation of multiple gains.

## Testing the model on additional datasets #######################
We tested the model on three additional datasets, which were not included in the original manuscript. The enclosed document “new_datasets.pdf” describes these three experiments, their purpose, and depicts the data and model fits for each observer. This shows that the model is able to: generate sensible estimates of arousal for cases in which (1) the task difficulty was randomized across trials, (2) the task difficulty was alternated every 5 trials in a block design, (3) the stimulus was in an annulus around fixation rather than in the periphery, and (4) in the absence of a staircase / when the stimulus tilt was fixed (i.e., no external noise).
